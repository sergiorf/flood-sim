# Tickets

This file is the active local ticket queue for the repository.

Use it instead of GitHub issues when the coding environment is intentionally isolated from network and account access.

## Conventions

- Keep ticket IDs stable: `FS-001`, `FS-002`, and so on.
- Keep each ticket small enough to finish in one focused milestone.
- Remove completed tickets from this file once they no longer affect active planning.
- Update acceptance criteria, tests, and docs notes when scope changes.
- Keep the queue ordered so the next likely task appears near the top of `Todo`.
